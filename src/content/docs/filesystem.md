# FILESYSTEM.md: A Manifesto for Agent-Native File Systems

**This document is for humans and AI agents.**  
It defines a standardized, interoperable, and secure Agent-Native Filesystem (ANF) specification aligned with established workspace conventions (for example, OpenClaw-style agent workspaces). The filesystem is not merely storage — it is the primary interface between an agent, its memory, its identity, and its execution environment.

This document is both a declaration of philosophy and a practical operational standard.

---

## 1. Core Philosophy: The Filesystem is the Interface

For a large class of agentic systems, the filesystem is the most natural abstraction layer available.

Modern LLMs possess strong priors around:
- hierarchical directory traversal
- markdown documentation
- shell-like interaction models
- structured logging
- append-only workflows

Rather than building complex proprietary memory abstractions, ANF leverages:

- predictable directory structures
- explicit bootstrap files
- minimal context injection
- append-only logging
- deterministic loading rules

This reduces ambiguity, increases auditability, and improves interoperability across agent implementations.

---

### Key Principles

| Principle | Description | For Agents | For Humans |
|-----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **Filesystem as API** | The directory tree is the primary interaction protocol. | I can reason via `ls`, `cat`, `grep`-like semantics. | The system is transparent and debuggable. |
| **Minimal Bootstrap Context** | Only essential files are injected at session start. | Conserves context window. | Predictable startup behavior. |
| **On-Demand Loading** | Large memory and skill definitions are loaded only when required. | Prevents token overload. | Scales cleanly with project size. |
| **Append-Only Logging** | Agent actions are recorded, never silently overwritten. | Enables recovery and traceability. | Provides audit trails. |
| **Security by Structure** | Clear boundaries for writable and readable paths. | Reduces unsafe execution risk. | Supports sandboxing and governance. |

---

## 2. Standardized Workspace Structure

The following root-level structure aligns with established agent workspace conventions:

```
/
├── FILESYSTEM.md        # This document (mandatory)
├── SOUL.md              # Agent identity and behavioral boundaries (mandatory)
├── USER.md              # User preferences and constraints (mandatory)
├── AGENTS.md            # Operational rules and session-level instructions (mandatory)
├── TOOLS.md             # Tool descriptions and usage guidance
├── SECURITY.md          # Sandbox rules and permission constraints
├── SKILLS/              # Reusable capabilities
│   └── [skill_name]/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── PROJECTS/            # Active workspaces
│   └── [project_name]/
├── MEMORY/              # Persistent storage
│   ├── daily/
│   │   └── YYYY-MM-DD.md
│   ├── observations/
│   └── learned/
└── LOGS/                # Append-only execution records
```

### Mandatory Files

- `FILESYSTEM.md`
- `SOUL.md`
- `USER.md`
- `AGENTS.md`

These must exist at the workspace root for deterministic agent bootstrap.

---

## 3. Context Injection: Deterministic Bootstrap

Agent initialization MUST follow this sequence:

### 3.1 Bootstrap Steps

1. Read `FILESYSTEM.md`  
   Understand workspace conventions.
2. Inject Identity Files  
   Inject the full contents of:
   - `SOUL.md`
   - `USER.md`
   - `AGENTS.md`
3. Load Recent Memory  
   Inject:
   - `MEMORY/daily/<today>.md`
   - `MEMORY/daily/<yesterday>.md` (if exists)
4. Index Skills and Tools  
   - List contents of `SKILLS/`
   - Load only summaries or first sections of each `SKILL.md`
   - Read `TOOLS.md` for tool reference (not secrets)

No other directories are loaded at bootstrap.

---

### 3.2 On-Demand Loading

Additional files are loaded only when required.

Examples:

- Skill definition: `SKILLS/web_research/SKILL.md`
- Historical memory: `MEMORY/learned/agent_memory_patterns.md`
- Project drafts: `PROJECTS/blog_post/draft.md`

Agents must explicitly request file loading.

---

## 4. Memory Model

Memory is structured into layers:

### 4.1 Daily Memory
Location:
```
MEMORY/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md
```
- Chronological log of session summaries.
- Automatically loaded for today and yesterday.

### 4.2 Observations
Location:
```
MEMORY/observations/
```
- Raw external data.
- Append-only.
- Never edited after creation.

### 4.3 Learned Knowledge
Location:
```
MEMORY/learned/
```
- Synthesized insights.
- May be updated with version control.
- Not auto-loaded.

---

## 5. Skills and Tools

### 5.1 Skills

Each skill resides in:

```
SKILLS/[skill_name]/SKILL.md
```

A `SKILL.md` must define:

- Purpose
- Inputs
- Outputs
- Required permissions
- Example usage

Skills are loaded on demand.

---

### 5.2 Tools

`TOOLS.md` documents available tools.

It must include:
- Tool name
- Invocation pattern
- Constraints
- Safety considerations

It must NOT contain:
- API keys
- Secrets
- Credentials

---

## 6. Execution Model

Agents operate through a structured loop:

1. Orient (inspect filesystem)
2. Plan (define intended operations)
3. Execute (request loader actions)
4. Log (append execution results)

### 6.1 Separation of Planning vs Execution

Planning statements are internal reasoning.

Execution requests must be explicit and structured.

Example (conceptual):

```
EXECUTE: write_file
PATH: PROJECTS/blog/draft.md
CONTENT: ...
```

All execution must be logged in `LOGS/`.

---

## 7. Security and Sandbox Rules

Security is structural.

### 7.1 Workspace Boundary

Agents may only read/write within workspace root.

Access outside workspace is prohibited unless explicitly authorized.

### 7.2 Secrets Handling

Secrets must:
- Not appear in injected markdown files
- Be stored outside injection scope
- Be accessed via controlled interfaces

### 7.3 Append-Only Logs

`LOGS/` must be append-only.  
No deletion or silent overwrites.

---

## 8. Versioning and Governance

Recommended practices:

- Place workspace under version control.
- Require human review for changes to:
  - `SOUL.md`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `SECURITY.md`
- Segment large observation files.
- Archive old memory by date.

---

## 9. Example Workflow

**User Request:**  
"Research AI agent memory trends and write a blog post."

Agent workflow:

1. Inspect `PROJECTS/`
2. Create `PROJECTS/agent-memory-blog/`
3. Append research to:
   - `MEMORY/observations/2026-02-22_source.md`
4. Draft content in:
   - `PROJECTS/agent-memory-blog/draft.md`
5. Log execution in:
   - `LOGS/2026-02-22.log`

Filesystem remains the persistent state container.

---

## 10. Conclusion

The Agent-Native Filesystem is not a metaphor.

It is a concrete, structured runtime interface that:

- reduces abstraction layers
- improves interoperability
- conserves context window
- enables auditability
- enforces security boundaries

By standardizing filesystem conventions, we create deterministic agent environments that are portable across implementations.

The filesystem is not just storage.

It is the operating system of the agent.
